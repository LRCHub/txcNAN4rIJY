[00:49.93] And when you dream of your weekends
[00:56.45] The scent of the soft air
[01:00.10] The heat with the dull air
[01:05.52] As we stomp the skies
[01:09.12] We don't know atleast we try
[01:12.85] This moment did not change
[01:17.42] When morning comes remain
[01:29.92] 
[02:13.67] I'm wanting you to be the one
[02:30.91] I want you to be the one
